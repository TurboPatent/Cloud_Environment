Resource provisioning provides dynamic procurement of&nbsp;computing&nbsp;resources and other resources that are utilized to perform tasks within the&nbsp;Cloud&nbsp;computing&nbsp;environment. Metering and Pricing provide cost tracking as resources are utilized within the&nbsp;Cloudcomputing&nbsp;environment, and billing or invoicing for consumption of these resources. In one example, these resources may comprise application software licenses. Security provides identity verification for users and tasks, as well as protection for data and other resources. User portal provides access to the&nbsp;Cloud&nbsp;computing&nbsp;environment for both users and system administrators. Service level management provides&nbsp;Cloud&nbsp;computing&nbsp;resource allocation and management such that required service levels are met. Service Level Agreement (SLA) planning and fulfillment provides pre-arrangement for, and procurement of,&nbsp;Cloud&nbsp;computing&nbsp;resources for which a future requirement is anticipated in accordance with an SLA.
